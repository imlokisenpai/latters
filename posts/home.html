    <h1>All my life, the idea of home</h1>
  </header>

  <main class="post">
    <p>All my life, the idea of home has eluded me. Everywhere I went, I felt like a guest in my own existence — present, yet never belonging. Even when I tried to be part of something, I knew, deep down, that I never truly could. The world kept reminding me — in silence or in confrontation — that I was not home.</p>

    <p>Since the moment I began to understand what it means to be, all I’ve ever sought was a place that would not vanish, a corner of the world that would not crumble with time — a place I could call my own.</p>

    <p>I learned that Khudala was not home, nor Sindhari. I went to Hodu and found that my presence there, too, was a trespass. I built a small haven with my father, but it, like all things I loved, fell apart before I could grow into it. Now, though I have something I could call home, I am away from it — and that distance makes it as unreal as all the rest.</p>

    <p>My deepest desire is not wealth, glory, or knowledge. It is simple — a home that endures, people I can belong to without question: a family, a wife, children, a few souls who feel like constants in a world built of passing things.</p>

    <p>That, in the end, is my truth — not to own a home, but to be at home in the vast, uncertain theatre of existence.</p>
